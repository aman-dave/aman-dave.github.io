It is used in genome-scale reconstructions of metabolic networks. This project aims at building a web-based pipeline which will help in analysis. The user will be able to submit an SBML model, a representation format based on XML helping in the biological process, select one of the analysis methods and in turn, get a result that will be produced after passing the input through the pipeline. The pipeline will send the input to the COBRAPy microservice, which will return the result through node.js express routes and the results will be displayed via ReactJS frontend.</p>\n<h3>WHY THIS PROJECT?</h3>\n<p>Since I was a kid, working on cross-domain fields interests me. I have previously worked on a similar project, of building a react application from scratch, which gives me the necessary confidence of being able to complete it. That project was on a smaller scale and I felt I needed to understand the bigger complexity of doing similar work on a large scale where actual students like me would be benefited. </p>\n<h3>TOOLS AND FRAMEWORKS USED:</h3>\n<h5>FRONTEND</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ReactJs (JS library for UI)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple learning curve and past experience</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Redux, Easy-Peasy (State-Management)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Past experience and easy to implement</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reactstrap (Library for UI Components)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A vast library of components</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ccNetViz (Library for Graph representation)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Created by Helikar Labs itself, great support for bio-models</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Other libraries for smaller components</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 600px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b501cf1f7b7d623d93a5c1b09d009120/f0536/phaseOne.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 102.82738095238095%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Graph\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b501cf1f7b7d623d93a5c1b09d009120/34e8a/phaseOne.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b501cf1f7b7d623d93a5c1b09d009120/d4214/phaseOne.png 150w,\n/static/b501cf1f7b7d623d93a5c1b09d009120/135ae/phaseOne.png 300w,\n/static/b501cf1f7b7d623d93a5c1b09d009120/34e8a/phaseOne.png 600w,\n/static/b501cf1f7b7d623d93a5c1b09d009120/f0536/phaseOne.png 672w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h4>BACKEND</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>NodeJS (Server)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to utilize and past experience</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>POSTGRE SQL (Database)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The organization uses it</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sequelize (ORM)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very easy to understand CLI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PythonShell (Run Python Script in NodeJs)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very less line of code to run  Python with NodeJs </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MICROSERVICE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python </li>\n<li>\n<p>CobraPY (Interface to analyze constraint-based models)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very specific library to solve and analyze the specific model this project is based upon</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PROJECT MANAGEMENT</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GIT (Version Control)</li>\n<li>Docker (Virtual Container)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CHALLENGES FACED IN THE INITIAL FACE</h3>\n<p>The base of this project is based upon a biological model: Flux Balance Analysis. Having last studied anything related to biology in 10th grade, catching up with the biology terms was difficult.  It took quite some time to understand the whole architecture of the constraint-based model. Trying out a CobraPy, while it comes with its own excitement, was new to understand. </p>\n<h3>SKILLS/METHODOLOGIES PICKED UP IN THE FIRST PHASE</h3>\n<p>I have worked a lot with Git for version control and knew sometimes it created issues with dependencies on different machines. I had never tried to solve this issue. But since this project was being done with other people also using it and mentors keeping track of the work, it was necessary that project works and is consistent across all machines and systems. To solve this issue, Achilles, a mentor for my project, himself being an experienced developer, suggested to look up Docker and how to integrate it with the current application. It took some time to understand utilizing it with a bit of complex architecture such as my current project, it was worth it when the application worked like a charm.\nA component of the project is to develop graphs for visualization of the model. Using a new library, understanding how to use it, implementing it and looking at the amazing visuals the library created was an amazing experience. </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"python\"><pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\">Do <span class=\"token keyword\">not</span> waste time building the perfect model to start <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span> \nNo matter what<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> over the time of the project<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> the requirements will change<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> necessary changes will have to be implemented<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span> \nSo starting small <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> forming a base <span class=\"token keyword\">is</span> important than spending a ton of time\ncoming up <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> the perfect architecture<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>One of the side tasks Achilles suggested was to try to host the whole application on a cloud service so that it could be tested by other developers. Although I have used a few of the cloud service before, deploying the whole application was new to me. This skill is definitely one of the things I am taking back from the project.</p>\n<h3>IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</h3>\n<p>The project requires me to build an application that takes in an SBML model, read its content, parse them to frontend and display them on UI. I created a backend server using Nodejs and used express routes to send and receive data from users. The first API I built was to take in a file uploaded by the user from UI and send it to a SBML FILE PARSER. I built the parser in python and used one of the frameworks which support biological models: cobraPy. On receiving the file, the parser generates a JSON object that is sent back to UI using the same route. </p>\n<p>JSON MODEL SENT TO UI * : </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n       <span class=\"token string\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> model<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>name<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> \n\n\n       <span class=\"token string\">\"metabolites\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> metabolitesData<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n\n       <span class=\"token string\">\"reactions\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> reactionsData<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n\n       <span class=\"token string\">\"genes\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> genesData\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">The model will change during the duration of the project, based upon necessary requirements. \nOnce the UI has the necessary data in the form of JSON, it renders it using the bootstrap grid format.\nThe graph is visualized through ccNetViz. A list of reactions, metabolites, and genes is displayed as columns.\nUsers can click on any of the elements to get more information regarding the respective elements in a box displayed below those lists.`</code></pre></div>\n<h3>THOUGHTS ON THE SECOND PHASE</h3>\n<p>Currently, the application has two tabs, Model and Simulation. The model tab contains details about the model uploaded, can visualize its corresponding graph using ccNetiViz. It the recent update, you can now filter the graph based upon the compartments of metabolites and reactions. The simulation tab uses the same model to perform simulations. The user can change the upper and lower bounds of a reaction,  as well as knock off the genes present in the model.\nIn the coming evaluation, I have to make sure that the graph rendered on Simulation tab changes according to flux control, i.e. values of upper and lower bounds and the genes knocked off. I am facing certain issues regarding rebuilding the model which has to be parsed to cobraPy. Once I overcome the persisting issues and am able to change the width of reactions edges in the graph according to fluxes, the upcoming task shall be easy to complete.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\">Creating the first component is always the hardest<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> \nover time the complexity keeps on decreasing drastically moving forward.</code></pre></div>\n<p>I have to build 3 different types of Simulations, but as they say, the first one is always the hardest, similarly once I am done with my first simulation, here Flux Balance Analysis, the other 2 simulations should be easier to implement and take less time. </p>\n<h3>A BIT OF MY BACKGROUND</h3>\n<p>I am a Full Stack Developer, an open source contributor, an avid photographer and above all a Tech enthusiast. Contributing to projects, programming and helping others to find solutions to technical problems is what I love to do. I started programming in my High School with C and then went on to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After my first year as an undergraduate, I started learning ReactJS and from there on, I was able to use my skills to work on two Industry level React Projects. For the past few months, I have shifted my focus toward backend architecture, learning Node.Js and recently I’ve started learning AWS. During the last month, along with GSoC, I have started learning Data Science on DataCamp. It has one of the best career tracks available: Data Scientist with Python, consisting of around 90 hours. My aim is to finish that tracks in July, right now I have finished -80% of the tracks. After that, I will try to complete some of the projects available on DataCamp and then dive into building some of my own projects.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 29, 2019","title":"GSoC Phase One"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/gsocphaseone/"}}}
